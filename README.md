Escaping prisoners will now get fired upon by turrets. 

In 1.3 rebelling slaves will also be shot, selectable in the options.
There is also an option for shooting at slaves/prisoners in any aggro mental-state

Turrets can also give terror to slaves to keep supression levels.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
